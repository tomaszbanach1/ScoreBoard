# ScoreBoard
Simple library to present actual games

Assumption:
1. This will be used in different application with DI,
2. InMemoryRepository is just for development purpose and real repository with any data storage should handle sorting.
3. implement as ScoreBoard as Football World Cup Score Board is only use case and lots of different sports or event could use the same score board or extend this.
